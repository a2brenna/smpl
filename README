Simple Message Passing Library (SMPL)

This library hopes to be a cross platform, cross language mechanism for
atomically passing arbitrary finite length messages between threads, processes,
programs and machines.  Hopefully with consistent syntax and semantics.
Provides a unified wrapper for synchronized communication between threads,
network sockets, unix domain sockets, TLS, SSH etc.  Should be fairly
extensible, adding new transport layers and their associated addressing systems
should be fairly painless and more importantly should not require retooling
by any clients.

The reference implementation is in C++, as well as the initial performance
benchmarks.

Also plan a Rust implementation.

By using capabilities and serializing addresses it might be possible to fairly
universally pass Channels over Channels... that would be pretty drugs.
