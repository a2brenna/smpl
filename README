Simple Message Passing Library (SMPL)

This library hopes to be a cross platform, cross language mechanism for
atomically passing arbitrary finite length messages between threads, processes,
programs and machines.  Hopefully with consistent syntax and semantics.

The reference implementation is in C++, as well as the initial performance
benchmarks.
